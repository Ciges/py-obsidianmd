A python library for [ObsidianMD](https://obsidian.md/).

Currently focused on enabling obsidian users to **experiment between different ways of organizing their notes metadata**. See the [full reference here](https://selimrbd.github.io/py-obsidianmd/)

<br>

:warning: so far the library has been tested on very few different vaults. **Consider backing up your vault** or committing it to git before testing it, to avoid any risk of data loss.
